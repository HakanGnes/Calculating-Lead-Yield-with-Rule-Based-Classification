Business Problem: A game company wants to create new level-based customer definitions (personas) 
by using some characteristics of its customers, create segments according to these new customer definitions, 
and estimate how much new customers can bring to the company on average based on these segments.

## Dataset Story: Persona.csv dataset contains the prices of the products sold by 
an international game company and some demographic information of the users who purchased these products. 
The data set consists of records created in each sales transaction. This means the table is not deduplicated. 
In other words, a user with certain demographic characteristics may have made more than one purchase.
